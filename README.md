#React Boilerplate w/ Redux/React-Router/Redux-Thunk/CSS-Modules

I put this together as a boilerplate for the best parts of React.  Here is a list of all the extras:
1. React
2. Redux
3. React-Router
4. Redux-Thunk
5. CSS-Modules

This was built starting with `create-react-app`, and then ejecting *everything*.
