# React Boilerplate w/ Redux/React-Router/Redux-Thunk/CSS-Modules

I put this together as a boilerplate for the best parts of React.  Here is a list of all the extras:
1. React
2. [react-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) (state management)
3. [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) (routing)
4. [redux-thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) (actions as functions)
5. CSS-Modules (the only way to write css with react)

I got tired of trying to combine projects that had one piece or another. I didn't have a single project that had all these pieces. So, I built a boilerplate. I followed 2 different articles to help build this out. But I had to make some changes to make everything work correctly.


This was built starting with `create-react-app`, and then ejecting *everything*.  I have used the `now` CLI to test and everything is working as expected.
